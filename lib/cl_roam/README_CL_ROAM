How to use the plugin

You need two wifi-interfaces, called ath0 and ath1. ath1 is used for your normal meshing-setup. ath0 is your interface for the Accesspoint. Make sure every Node has the same IP and mac-adress on this interface.

Make sure, dnsmasq dhcp-leasefile is located at /var/dhcp.leases and is accessible via http://IPADRESS/dhcp.leases. dnsmasq needs to give leases on ath0.

Do not add ath0 as an interface in olsrd.conf, but add a line like this:

   LoadPlugin "/root/olsrd_cl_roam.so.0.1"
   {
   }


Make sure routing between ath0 and ath1 is possible (without nat!) and routing between ath0 and eth0 is natted.
