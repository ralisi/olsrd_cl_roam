   Using access control lists in OLSRd
=========================================

Several plugins in OLSRd allow you to limit the access to
their server functions by IP. This file will explain how to
use the ACL features.
 
The access is controlled by two lists of ip
addresses and ip networks, a blacklist (reject list) and
a whitelist (accept list). Two binary flags control which
list is to be used first and what should be the default
reaction to an unknown IP.

The parameter "accept" contains an IP address or network
which is allowed to access the service, the parameter "reject"
contains a IP/network which is NOT allow to access it.

The parameter "checkfirst" tells the service which of the
two lists have to be checked first.
The default setting is "reject".

The last parameter "defaultpolicy" controls what the server
should do with IPs which are not found in BOTH lists.
The default setting is "reject".


   Examples for ACL usage
============================

Examples for parameters accept/reject:
PlParam   "accept"   "10.0.0.0/8" 
PlParam   "reject"   "10.0.0.1" 
PlParam   "accept"   "10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0" 

Examples for parameters for binary flags
PlParam   "checkfirst"      "reject"
PlParam   "defaultpolicy"   "accept"


   Legacy parameters
=======================
The old parameters "host", "host4", "host6", "net", "net4"
and "net6" are just alias names for "accept".
