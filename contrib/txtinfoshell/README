   txtinfo shell
===================

txtinfo-sh is a small helper programm to allow external users a secure
access to the txtinfo plugin. It can be used as a shell for an user
in /etc/passwd and connects the incoming ssh session directly to port 2006
of the olsrd txtinfo plugin. The txtinfo itself have to be configured to
allow access by 127.0.0.1.

If txtinfo is running on another port change the DEFAULT_TXTINFO_PORT
constant in txtinfoshell.c or use a shell script as a wrapper that
starts txtinfo-sh with the port number as the only parameter.
