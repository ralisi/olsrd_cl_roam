   HTTP/Telnet services in olsrd
===================================

Olsrd contains an integrated telnet and http server core, which is
used by plugins and the core to provide easy access the html pages
and text commands.


   HTTP services
-------------------

The http server core supports both GET and POST parameter processing,
allows the plugin/provider to set up a ACL and provides http basic
password authentification (should be used together with an https proxy
for security).

Plugins use the function olsr_com_add_htmlsite() to set up a static
webpage for a filename or a whole path, the function
olsr_com_add_htmlhandler() can be used to set up a callback for dynamic
webpage generation.

olsr_com_set_htmlsite_acl_auth() can be used on the returned
olsr_html_site pointer from one of the "add" functions to set up an
ip ACL and/or a list of username/passwords. The username/password
strings must be base64 encoded as defined in the http basic
authentification standard.
(see  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication )


   Telnet services
---------------------

The telnet server implements a simple text interface to the olsr core,
which can be equipped with any number of commands.

The first way to use a telnet command is to enter the commands name,
followed by it's parameters (similar to a normal console). After the
command is finished, a new prompt will be displayed and you can
enter another command.

The second way is to prefix a command with a '/' character. No parameters
can be used in this mode, but multiple commands can be concatenated in
a single line. After the last command finished the telnet server will
hang up. This mode emulates the commands of the old txtinfo plugin.

Some commands will not stop after a predefined output but will continue
to output data to the console. They can be stopped by sending a single
character to the telnet server.

The server will hang up the connection if no input/output happens for
a certain period of time (default 120 seconds).


   Builtin telnet commands
-----------------------------

"quit" or "exit":
  Ends the telnet session and hangup the connection.

"help":
  Displays a list of available commands.

"help <commandname>":
  Displays a help text for a certain command (if available).

"csv":
  Activates the csv (comma separated value) output mode. All
  commands capable to use this flag will switch to a CSV output
  format.

"csvoff"
  Deactivates the csv output mode.

"timeout <seconds>":
  Sets the telnet session timeout to a new value. A parameter
  of '0' will deactivate the timeout.

"version"
  Displays a version string of the olsrd.

"repeat <seconds> <command and parameters>":
  Calls another internal command every few seconds. Of course
  the other command must not be one with continous output
  itself.
